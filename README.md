WebForAll

Accessibility for the web is crucial because it ensures that websites and web applications can be used by a wide range of people, including those with disabilities or impairments. 

Adding aria-label and aria-describedby attributes to HTML elements is important for creating accessible web content, especially for users with disabilities. These attributes play a crucial role in making web applications and websites more inclusive and usable. 


How did we achieve it?

We’ve fine tuned open ai model to automatically generate  aria-label and aria-describedby attributes for your code. For now we’ve created a prototype of how the process will look like. We’re working on making a Visual Code extension that automatically suggests these changes.
