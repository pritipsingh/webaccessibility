<h1>Contributing to Transcriptase</h1> <br/>
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

<h1>Reporting a bug</h1>

Proposing new features
<h1>Becoming a maintainer</h1>
We develop with Github <br>
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.<br>
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). <br>

We actively welcome your pull requests:
<h3>Fork the repo and create your branch from main.</h3>
-If you've added code that should be tested, please condider adding relevant test cases.<br>
-If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.<br>
-Ensure the test suite passes.<br>
-Make sure your code lints.<br>
-Issue that pull request!<br><br>

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License<br>
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. <br>Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

<h1>Report bugs using Github's issues</h1>
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs, you can report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

<h1>Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code</h1>
<h1>Great Bug Reports tend to have:</h1>
<b>
-A quick summary and/or background<br>
-Steps to reproduce<br>
-Be specific!<br></b><br>
 Give sample code if you can. My stackoverflow question includes sample code that anyone with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing<br>
1)What you expected would happen<br>
2)What actually happens<br>
3)Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)<br>
<br><br>
<i>People love reading thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.</i>

<h1>Use a Consistent Coding Style</h1>
I'm again borrowing these from Facebook's Guidelines<br>
*Try to use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs<br>
You can try running <b>-npm run lint</b> for style unification
